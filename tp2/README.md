## Project information

### Strong points of our project
  - We used animation in differents components
  - We used the shader between color and texture
  - We changed the plane to a nurbs
  - We followed the week plan strictly 
  - We were criative when making the scene

### Scene
  - The original scene consists of a beach. 
  - There is a whale in the sea that flaps its tail and its blowhole is animated
  - An octapus that attacks the boat and sinks it
  - The barrels that roll along the beach into the ocean
  - The volley ball that goes back and forth in the field
  - A piramid that flies
  - A floater that pulses, changing color and its vertices 
  - The beach tent is used with nurbs
